Each subject is scored on a scale of 0 to 100, and the grades are classified as follows:\n\n- 90 to 100: A\n- 80 to 89: B\n- 70 to 79: C\n- 60 to 69: D\n- Below 60: F\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Ask the user to enter the scores for each of the four subjects (Math, Science, English, and History).\n2. Calculate the average score by summing the four scores and dividing by 4.\n3. Based on the average score, determine the corresponding grade using if-else statements.\n4. Display the average score and the corresponding grade.\n\nExample Output:\n\nEnter the score for Math: 85\n\nEnter the score for Science: 92\n\nEnter the score for English: 78\n\nEnter the score for History: 88\n\nAverage Score: 85.75\n\nGrade: B",
