    "Comments in Python are lines that begin with the hash symbol (#). They are used to add explanatory notes within the code and are ignored by the Python interpreter during program execution. Comments help improve code readability and serve as documentation for the code. Apart from single-line comments, Python also supports multi-line comments using triple quotes (''' ''') for strings or triple double quotes (\"\"\" \"\"\") for multi-line strings, although these are not true comment symbols. Using comments effectively is a good practice to make code more understandable and maintainable."
